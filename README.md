# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Social-Media-Data
We use data from social media platforms like Twitter to get a training dataset. Then we construct a dictionary out of it. The dictionary consists of data which classifies words as positive, neutral and negative.
This will help people in some specific professions to analyze the data and help a person if needed.
Today's generation is very much dependent on social media for their emotions. So, any interaction with any post on social media or any caption written by them on social media will state their state of mind thus psychiatrists can use this data to help determine whether their patient is in depression or not and to what end the patient needs help.
