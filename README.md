# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Social-Media-Data
We are using data from social media platforms like twitter to get us a training dataset. Then we are constructing a dictonary out of it. The dictonary consists of data which classifies words as positive, neutral and negative.
This will help people in some specific profession to analyze the data and help a person if needed.
Todays generation is very much dependent on social media for their emotions. So, any interaction with any post of social media or any caption written by then on social media will state theit state of mind thus psychiatrists can use this data to help whether their patient is in depression or not and to what end the patient needs help.
